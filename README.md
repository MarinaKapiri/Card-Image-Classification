# Card-Image-Classification
This code implements a full pipeline for training a deep learning model to classify playing cards using PyTorch and TIMM. It begins by defining a custom dataset class to load and preprocess images, followed by creating a model based on EfficientNet, tailored to output 53 classes. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss with an Adam optimizer, including learning rate scheduling and early stopping to enhance performance. Finally, it includes functions for testing the model on new images and visualizing the prediction results.
